# Warcraftlogs App Project
This app was made for World of Warcraft players and basically grabs data from warcraftlogs database and allows you to get the "Best Perfect Average Score" from Warcraftlogs after filling some specific fields like the name of the character, realm, role and number of the raid size. E.g. "Gulwyn"; "Benediction"; "Retribution"; 25;
